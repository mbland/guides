# Guides

This is a repository of software development and organizational practices.
They're open source, and you're free to use them as you wish. The hope is that
teams everywhere will adopt or modify the practices outlined here.

By developing this material in the open, we hope to encourage expert review and
contributions from members of the tech community, furthering our goal of
improving how society works through the adoption of responsible conventions.

To create a new Guide, or to update an existing guide to the Guides format, 
see the [Guides Template][].
